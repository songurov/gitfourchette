# GitFourchette version history

## Unreleased — fork changes (songurov/gitfourchette, branch `feature/workspaces`)

Work in this fork that has not been released or submitted upstream. See
[docs/](docs/) for the architecture notes, roadmap and design decisions behind it.

New features:

- **Workspaces:** name a set of repositories (Work, Home, Client A) and switch
  between them from the Workspace menu or Quick Launch. Home is the empty
  workspace and shows the repository browser.
- **Worktree management:** create, lock, unlock, remove and prune worktrees from
  the sidebar. A worktree another tab has open is protected from removal.
- **Ask AI:** ask Codex or Claude about commits, branches or developer activity.
  The assistant reads by default; tick "Let it change files" and it may also edit
  the working directory, but it never commits, stages or pushes. Screenshots can
  be attached to a question, and the status line reports how long the CLI has
  been working.
- **Conflict editor:** settle a conflicted file side by side inside the app,
  driven from the keyboard, with line endings preserved. Settling one file leads
  to the next. "See what a merge in history decided" reconstructs the decisions
  behind an existing merge commit.
- **Home:** scans the machine for repositories on its own thread, shows READMEs
  and per-repository status, and never freezes the window.

Quality of life improvements:

- Neutral look: reworked toolbar layout, thin-line icon set, round "+" tab
  button, status bar as a footer.
- Graph: a branch chip reports how many commits it has left to push.
- Git Flow: finish a feature and pick it up again after a conflict; initialize a
  repository the git-flow way from the Repo menu.
- Working directory: a clean one says "Nothing to commit" and offers the push.
- Side-by-side diff, file lists, commit form and Quick Launch refinements.

Documentation:

- Corrected the Ask AI section of the README, which described the assistant as
  read-only after the write mode had been added.
- Added `docs/` with architecture notes, a staged roadmap, a Git feature coverage
  matrix, UX guidelines, and ADRs covering the desktop stack, the worktree
  control center, agentic mode and the relationship with upstream.


## 1.11.0 (2026-08-21)

New features:

- **Blame specific line:** Right click any line in the diff, then select "Blame Line" to find out which commit introduced this specific line.
- **Bypass pre-commit hooks** via dedicated button in CommitDialog (git commit --no-verify). The button is only shown if your repo uses pre-commit hooks.
- **New platform-agnostic themes** (light & dark) provide a nicer default look on non-Qt environments. You can still use any Qt styles you have installed on your system.

Quality of life improvements:

- Conflicts: You can now preview the entire "Ours" or "Theirs" revision with one click (eye button in ConflictView)
- Conflicts: Operations "Keep Ours" and "Accept Theirs" now ask for your confirmation and clearly explain what is going to happen
- CloneDialog: "Default clone location" settings are easier to access from the Browse button

Bug fixes:

- Blame: More accurate revlist when blaming a file in a branch that has diverged from the current branch
- Tab names were elided too aggressively with "tab close button" on and "expand tabs" off

## 1.10.0 (2026-08-01)

New features:

- CommitDialog: Dedicated "signoff" button (git commit --signoff)
- Open repo workdir in external editor (from Repo menu, or by right-clicking a repo tab) (#118)

Quality of life improvements:

- Askpass: Better UI when connecting to an unknown host (#128)
- Specific "No changes" message when A/B diffing two commits with the same tree
- Conflict resolution: Improved compatibility with merge tools that write the merged file from a different process after a delay (some popular IDEs)

Bug fixes:

- Fix stash deletion failing when trash is disabled (#122)
- Cherrypick/Revert: Show meaningful error message if git exits with code 128, typically "local changes would be overwritten" (#130)
- Flatpak: Fix ssh-agent sandboxed state after changing git executable from settings
- Subpatch extraction: Don't spill over to first line in next hunk if selection ends on hunk header (was only an issue with context lines turned off)
- FileList: Edit HEAD Version in Editor: Get file from HEAD, not index if it has staged changes
- Restore Revision and Save Revision As were rewritten to use git restore/git cat-file, fixing issues with restoring symlinks
- DiffView: Reevaluate search term when switching to a different diff document

Security fixes:

- Custom Commands that manipulate the selected object via tokens like $FILE or $REF now safely escape the object's name before substitution. In a hostile repo, this prevents malicious filenames or ref names from injecting tokens into a Custom Command that you run on them.

Maintenance & packaging notes:

- Bump minimum Python version to 3.12 (previously 3.10)
- Make Pygments a mandatory dependency (previously optional)
- Enforce type checking with mypy (#2)


## 1.9.1 (2026-07-14)

Quality of life improvements:

- Add Ghostty terminal preset (#116)
- More legible text contrast in the sidebar in some desktop environments (Fedora/GNOME)

Bug fixes:

- Fix "repo nickname" dialog introduced in 1.9.0 didn't save nickname across sessions
- Fix regression in trash system (first discard after fresh install) (#119)
- Fix "empty trash" didn't clean up trashed symlinks

## 1.9.0 (2026-07-01)

New features:

- Show/hide whitespace symbols (#108)
- Options to ignore whitespace in diffs (#108)

Quality of life improvements:

- Tool buttons above DiffView give quick access to: word wrap, whitespace, context lines, SVG preview (#108)
- NewTagDialog offers replacing existing local tags (#102)
- Tabs: Disambiguate tab labels when several repos share the same basename (#113)
- The "repo nickname" feature is now easier to access (right-click on a tab → Rename)
- Blame: Reevaluate search term when switching to another revision
- Allow resizing Commit Info dialog when showing a long commit message (#109)
- Allow Keypad Enter to accept dialogs in non-KDE environments, in addition to the main Return key which was supported since 1.5.0. (Note: KDE already supports this by default.) (#110)

Bug fixes:

- Fix benign error message on startup if you ticked a "Don't Show Again" checkbox in a previous session (#112)
- Blame: Fix crash when blaming workdir file during merge in progress
- Handle edge cases in "Added by both"/"Deleted by both" conflicts involving symlinks (#115)
- Fix minor UX papercuts with very long repository tab names
- NewRepo: Fix button label in non-empty directory warning
- NewRepo: Restore "Create" button in nested repository warning

Maintenance:

- Continued from work started in v1.5.0, more operations were rewritten to be implemented with "standard" Git instead of libgit2 for improved compatibility (New Tag, Delete Tag, Resolve by Keeping Ours/Taking Theirs).

## 1.8.0 (2026-05-21)

New features:

- **Search for commits touching a file.** In the Commit History, press Ctrl+F (or /), then change the search scope from "Info" to "Paths".
- **Search for refs in the sidebar.** In the Sidebar, press Ctrl+F (or /) to filter branches, tags, or stashes.

Bug fixes:

- Fix icon for good SSH signature validation when principal name contains spaces (#105)
- Refresh workdir when 'git cherrypick' reports conflicts
- Friendly error message if Blame keyboard shortcut is pressed when no file is selected

## 1.7.1 (2026-04-11)

Fix regression in 1.7.0 where RefreshRepo couldn't be canceled effectively.

## 1.7.0 (2026-04-09)

New features:

- **Compare two commits.** Hold the Control key while selecting two commits in the history to diff them.
- **Improved LFS integration.** A special icon appears next to LFS-tracked files. Images and text files stored as LFS can now be diffed. Actions such as "Restore File Revision" are now LFS-aware.
- **Upstream status indicators in sidebar.** Ahead/behind by N commits, upstream branch missing.
- **Customizable mouse shortcuts in file lists and tab bar.** You can now bind the double-click and middle-click to different actions (stage, blame, open, reveal).

Quality of life improvements:

- Unstage both addition and deletion when unstaging a rename (#87)
- New "Filename First" path display style (#86)
- Replace spaces with dashes in branch name input fields (#88)
- Consistently crisp icon rendering on high-DPI displays
- Faster large-blob detection (requires pygit2 1.19.2 or newer)
- Queue up to 1 action if busy with another non-interruptible task (replacing the "please wait for current task to complete" dialog)

Bug fixes:

- Fix line-by-line staging if filename contains non-ASCII characters (#89)
- Fix sidebar context menu on local branches whose upstream is set to a symbolic ref (#92)
- Resolve gitdir path so symlinked repo roots don't trigger error (#92)
- Fix author signature couldn't be overridden when concluding a cherrypick
- Fix repo wouldn't reload after raising max commit count from "History Truncated" page
- Fix keyboard shortcut conflicts on Cinnamon

## 1.6.0 (2026-02-01)

New features:

- **Mount commits as folders.** This lets you browse the workdir at a specific point in time using your system's file manager. Available by right-clicking a commit in the Commit History. (FUSE 3 required + new optional dependency 'mfusepy')
- **Auto-fetch remotes periodically (experimental).** Enable this *Settings → Advanced → Auto-fetch remotes every N minutes.*

Quality of life improvements:

- FileList: Improve path readability by muting color of directory string (#77)
- GraphView context menu: Show branch name instead of "Reset HEAD to Here" (#71)
- GraphView context menu: Offer merging for any commit, not just branch tips (#74)
- Image diffs: Ability to toggle between old/new images
- Blame: Emphasize "new" lines with a different background color in the gutter
- Allow pressing the Escape key to quickly close detached diff/blame windows

Bug fixes:

- Fix impossible to open worktrees located in a subdirectory of a bare repo (#82)
- When a merge is blocked by untracked files that would be overwritten, show an error message (instead of denying the merge silently)

Maintenance:

- Continued from the work started in v1.5.0, more operations now use "standard" Git instead of libgit2. This should be transparent to most users; others may benefit from better interoperability with their Git setup. (Reworked operations include: Workdir Status, Commit Diffs, Export Patch, Blame/Revlist, Register/Remove Submodule, New Repository, Add/Remove/Edit Remote, Restore files after stashing)
- Some work on Windows compatibility (experimental)

## 1.5.0 (2025-09-08)

**Major change: Better integration with standard Git tooling.** GitFourchette now uses git instead of libgit2 to edit repositories and communicate with remotes. This enables seamless integration into workflows that depend on OpenSSH, hooks, etc.

The Flatpak version comes bundled with a Git distribution so you can use it without any additional setup. For more control, you can switch to your system's Git install via *Settings → Git Integration*.

New features:

- **GPG-sign your commits.** Look for a little key icon in the Commit Dialog. (#63)
- **Verify commit signatures in the commit history.** *Settings → Commit History → Verify signed commits on the fly*. (#59)

Quality of life improvements:

- Force push with lease (#61)
- Sidebar: Bold current commit and upstream (#60)
- Sidebar: Allow collapsing/expanding all folders from Local Branches context menu
- Keep syntax highlighting active while a search term is being highlighted
- In non-KDE environments (e.g. GNOME), the Return key can now be used to confirm most dialogs regardless of the focused widget (note: KDE already allowed this) (#68)

Bug fixes:

- Fix rendering of Unicode surrogate pairs in character-level diffs (#58)
- Fix parent commit links in Get Commit Info (regression in 1.4.0)

Breaking changes due to integration with Git tooling:

- Passphrase saving has been delegated to ssh-agent. Some Linux distros like Ubuntu and Fedora provide an ssh-agent out of the box. As a fallback, you can have GitFourchette spin up an ssh-agent for you via *Settings → Git Integration → ssh-agent*.
- Per-remote custom SSH keys aren't supported anymore. You can set per-host keys in *~/.ssh/config* to achieve the same effect; or, you can set per-repo custom SSH keys in *Repo → Repo Settings → Log in to SSH remotes with custom key file*.

Note: Although many commands now call git, libgit2 (via pygit2) is still used internally to build a model of the repo.

## 1.4.0 (2025-07-14)

New features:

- Blame/File History. Within GitFourchette, right-click any file and select "Blame File"; or, drag any file in your repo from your file manager and drop it onto the main window to view its history.

Quality of life improvements:

- An informative "drop zone" now appears when you drag an item from an external program over the main window. This tells you what will happen upon dropping the item (open repo folder, open repo containing a file, blame file in current repo, apply patch file, clone URL).
- CheckoutCommitDialog: Also offer Merge, Reset HEAD
- New branch/tag name validation: Friendly warning if attempting to create a folder with the same name as an existing ref
- CodeView: Toggling Word Wrap now preserves your scroll position in the document
- FileList: Reevaluate search term when jumping to another commit
- DiffGutter: Enable high-DPI custom cursor on Wayland

Bug fixes:

- Fix "Detect Renames" may unexpectedly switch to the workdir in rare cases
- Flatpak distribution: Updated to Pygments 2.19.2 to fix problems with Lua syntax highlighting

## 1.3.0 (2025-05-03)

**Upgrade note:** The terminal command template now requires the `$COMMAND` argument placeholder. Please review your terminal command in *Settings → External Tools → Terminal*.

New features:

- Custom terminal commands (Settings → Custom Commands) (#37).
- Sidebar: Hide All But This (#49). You can now show a single branch and hide all others.
- Add file to .gitignore or .git/info/exclude from untracked file context menu (#42)

Quality of life improvements:

- GraphView: Conjoined refboxes when a local branch is in sync with its upstream (#12)
- Add target branch shorthand to default merge commit message (#39)
- NewBranchDialog: Pre-tick upstream checkbox if branching off remote branch
- Report mandatory placeholder token errors when launching external tool commands
- Speed up remote listing and upstream lookup
- Fix Sidebar/DiffArea would sometimes jump around by a few pixels while temporary banners were shown
- Override Yaru icon theme's "scary" red warning icon (#27)
- More helpful message if Python bindings for QtSvg are missing

Bug fixes:

- Sidebar: Strip initial slash in nested RefFolder display names (#45)
- Fix Ctrl+G keyboard shortcut on GNOME
- Work around window snapping issue on GNOME (#50)

Two other bug fixes originally introduced in v1.2.0 had been dormant until now due to depending on a pygit2 version bump – they are now in full effect:

- Fix push progress wasn't reported properly during transfer (requires pygit2 1.18.0) (#22)
- Fix push couldn't be canceled once the transfer starts (requires pygit2 1.18.0) (#22)

## 1.2.1 (2025-03-05)

User-suggested quality of life improvements:

- GraphView: Copy commit message from context menu (#33)
- Rephrase some messages (diff too large, delete untracked file) (#27, #28)
- Add Ptyxis terminal preset (#18)

Other quality of life improvements:

- Friendlier messages related to 'autocrlf' and 'safecrlf' options (#30)
- Flatpak distribution: Detach terminal process from application
- Improve contrast between enabled/disabled SVG icons throughout the UI
- Pasting a multiline commit message into CommitDialog's summary input box will correctly split the message across the summary and description boxes

Bug fixes:

- Fix error when an external program converts line endings in the workdir with 'autocrlf' (#30)
- Flatpak distribution: Fix terminal spawned in incorrect working directory (#18)
- Flatpak distribution: Fix Flatpak tool existence check
- Gracefully handle destruction of parent widget of external tool processes

## 1.2.0 (2025-02-19)

New features:

- Open terminal in workdir (#18)

User-suggested quality of life improvements:

- Reword "Uncommitted changes" to "Working directory" to clear up any confusion when there are no changes (#13)
- Always display the number of uncommitted changes in the sidebar and in the graph; update this whenever the app returns to the foreground (#13)
- Reword "Discard Changes" context menu entry for untracked files to "Delete File" (#17)
- Global ref sorting setting (#20)
- Allow creating a merge commit without fast-forwarding (#21)
- Dark mode readability tweaks (#24)
- Command line: Open arbitrary nested paths in a repo (#25)

Other quality of life improvements:

- Improve consistency of ellipses in menus to signify that an action can be canceled
- Warn user if an external Flatpak isn't installed when attempting to run it (merge tool, terminals, etc.)
- Remind user about any unstaged files when about to create an empty commit
- Allow middle-clicking to quickly stage/unstage selected lines in DiffView (enable in Settings → Advanced → Middle-click)
- Allow clearing draft commit messages by right-clicking the top row in GraphView
- After pushing a branch that doesn't track an upstream, PushDialog will suggest the remote branch you used previously (instead of defaulting to the first one in the repo)
- Pulling will automatically fast-forward if possible without an extra confirmation step, unless your git config contains "pull.ff=false" (behavior aligned to vanilla git). If fast-forwarding isn't possible, you will still be prompted to merge.
- Push/fetch status text uses the 'tnum' OpenType feature to avoid transfer rate numbers jumping around if your system font has digits with uneven widths
- AppImage distribution now compatible with fuse3

Bug fixes:

- Fix crash when closing several repos in quick succession, e.g. by holding down Ctrl+W
- Fix clicking the help button used to close the fast-forward dialog
- Fix DiffView out of sync with rest of RepoWidget after hiding a the currently-selected branch tip
- Fix italics in sidebar didn't update after changing the current branch's upstream (a remote-tracking branch in italics means it's the upstream for the current branch)
- Fix visual artifacts around character-level diffs in DiffView
- Fix push progress wasn't reported properly during transfer (requires pygit2 1.18.0) (#22)
- Fix push couldn't be canceled once the transfer starts (requires pygit2 1.18.0) (#22)

Breaking changes:

- The keyboard shortcut for "Go to Working Directory" is now Ctrl+G (formerly Ctrl+U, for "Uncommitted Changes"). On most keyboard layouts, Ctrl+G pairs nicely with Ctrl+H for "Go to HEAD".

## 1.1.1 (2025-01-19)

New features:

- Option to remember passphrases in encrypted keyfiles (#15)

Quality of life improvements:

- Omit remote name from refboxes when there's just 1 remote (#11)
- Display blob hashes in FileList tooltips
- GraphView tries to use the 'tnum' OpenType feature to align ISO-8601 dates if your system font has digits with uneven widths
- In commit/filename SearchBars, don't re-trigger a search if appending to a word that is known to have no occurrences

Bug fixes:

- Fix custom key file feature in CloneDialog and AddRemote
- Fix remote branch context menu in a repo with an unborn head
- GraphSplicer: Fix discrete branch may vanish from graph if moved past another branch by topological sorting

## 1.1.0 (2025-01-05)

New features:

- Syntax highlighting with Pygments (optional dependency)

- Fix web URLs in remote-tracking branch context menus (e.g. visit a branch on github.com)

## 1.0.1 (2024-12-03)

Quality of life improvements:

- Friendlier ConflictView UI
- Improve 3-way merging with external merge tools when there's no ancestor in the conflict
